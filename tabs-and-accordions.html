												<div class="accordion-content content">
													<p>Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology — distributed meaning not kept by one bookkeeper; a ledger is a book of records — where tamperproof 
                                                       records are shared among a group, so that they can form a consensus about a single truth. This allows parties that don’t fully trust each other to work 
                                                       together without the need of trusting each other nor does it need to place their trust collectively upon a central authority. Hence, blockchain solutions 
                                                       are sometimes synonymous with the term “decentralised applications” even though decentralisation is not the only nor the key benefit.</p>

													<p>An application is a specific implementation of a design, where craftsmanship quality is the emphasis. <br><br>

                                                        A system is a broader implementation of a design where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, where overall interplay of technical and complementary components is the key.<br><br>
                                                        
                                                        A solution first and foremost addresses a challenge or solves a problem. A complete solution fulfils its purpose within the scope of a defined problem or challenge without creating new problems or challenges.<br><br>

                                                        - A blockchain application is “blockchain code”, such as smart contracts, chaincode, cordapp, etc.<br>
                                                        - A blockchain system is not only has “blockchain code” but also backend code, frontend code, user interfaces, access control, processes, etc.<br>
                                                        - A blockchain solution is not only a system but also the governance and frameworks where various levels of privacy, security, and trust are supported.</p>

													<p>Participants of the International Blockchain Olympiad (IBCOL) are encouraged to be responsible contributors of our digital future: <br><br>


                                                        Promoting Awareness on Blockchain Technology & Applications: students from around the world will benefit from the experience of participating in the IBCOL program of activities, which includes seminar series, specialised training and workshops, mentoring, and networking events besides the actual competitions. This will cultivate a genuine interest in the area of innovation, originality, creativity and cutting-edge technology. It will also instil the right ethical values in the younger generation to pave the way for their further exploration of blockchain in the future.<br><br>
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        Enhancing Employability by Equipping Participants with helpful Skills: the prospective and actual participants will benefit tremendously from the IBCOL programme, as they learn practical skills and knowledge outside their disciplines and push the boundaries of their comfort zones. Students get a taste of the real world, and learn how to identify and overcome challenges in actually making something happen.</p>
